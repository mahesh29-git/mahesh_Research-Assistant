**Indiana Health Data Analysis - BHIRC**

**Project Overview**

This repository showcases the work done during my tenure as a Research Assistant at the Bio-Health Informatics Research Center (BHIRC). The goal was to clean, analyze, and interpret large-scale health datasets for improved reliability in statewide health analytics.

**Dataset Summary**

The dataset analyzed here contains health-related records, primarily focusing on COVID-19 and public health. It includes:

Dataset Sources: CDC, ASPA Media, NCHS, and other health organizations.

Data Characteristics: Instances, attributes, publication dates, and update history.

Size & Availability: Free and publicly available health datasets.

**Data Cleaning Process**

Standardized Topic Areas: Unified dataset naming conventions.

Formatted Date Columns: Converted publication and update dates to standardized datetime formats.

Processed Numeric Values: Converted values like 'K' (thousands) and 'M' (millions) to actual numbers.

Handled Missing Values: Analyzed and documented data gaps.

Removed Leading/Trailing Spaces: Cleaned up categorical fields.

**Key Insights & Findings**

Dataset Distribution by Topic: Majority of datasets relate to COVID-19.

Top Publishers: CDC and NCHS are leading contributors.

Update Frequency: Most datasets were actively updated during peak COVID-19 years.

Missing Values: Some datasets lacked availability details, but core data remained intact.
